# Object Oriented Programming
- It seemed necessary to have a Plot parent class, then make each separate type of 
plot a subclass of this parent class.

## Plot
- Parent class
- Each plot has the following:
    - Title
    - Selected file
    - SVG window DOM element, which has a width and height
    - Axes variables
        - xScale
        - yScale
        - axesContainer - container for the axes

## BarChart
- Child class
